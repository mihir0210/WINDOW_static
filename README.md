## WINDOW [A Multi-disciplinary Design Analysis & Optimization (MDAO) tool for wind turbine and wind farm analysis]

WINDOW contains a set of models for all the disciplines of a wind farm to evaluate various key indicators like the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE), farm NPV, IRR, etc. The framework includes models to various performance and cost models. It is written in Python and is built using OpenMDAO.
