**************************************************
Simple Optimization using Simultaneous Derivatives
**************************************************

Consider a set of points in 2-d space that are to be arranged along a circle such that the radius
of the circle is maximized, subject to constraints.  We start out with the points randomly
distributed within a unit circle centered about the origin.  The locations of our points are
determined by the values of the *x* and *y* arrays defined in our problem.

Total derivatives with respect to *x* and *y* will be solved for simultaneously based on the
color of the points shown below.  Note that we have two colors and our *x* and *y* design
variables are of size 10. We have a third design variable, *r*, that is size 1.
This means that if we don't solve for derivatives simultaneously, we must
perform 21 linear solves (10 + 10 + 1) to solve for total derivatives with respect to
all of our design variables.  But, since each of our *x* and *y* design variables have only
two colors, we can solve for all of our total derivatives using only 5 linear solves (2 + 2 + 1).
This means that using simultaneous derivatives saves us 16 linear solves each time we compute our
total derivatives.


Here's our problem at the start of the optimization:

After the optimization, all of our points lie along the unit circle.  The final radius is 1.0
(which corresponds to an area of PI) because we constrained our *x[0]* value to be 1.0.
