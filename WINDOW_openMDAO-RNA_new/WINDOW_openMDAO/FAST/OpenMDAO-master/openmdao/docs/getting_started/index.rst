.. _paraboloid_min:

Sample Optimization File
************************

With OpenMDAO installed, let's try out a simple example, to get you started running your first optimization.
Copy the following code into a file named paraboloid_min.py:

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.test_suite.test_examples.tldr_paraboloid.TestParaboloidTLDR.test_tldr
    :layout: code


Then, to run the file, simply type:

.. code::

    >> python paraboloid_min.py

If all works as planned, results should appear as such:


.. embed-code::
    openmdao.test_suite.test_examples.tldr_paraboloid.TestParaboloidTLDR.test_tldr
    :layout: output
