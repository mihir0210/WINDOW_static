Parallel Coloring for Multipoint or Fan-Out Problems
####################################################

In many models, there is an opportunity to parallelize across multiple points (e.g. multiple load cases for a structural optimization, multiple flight conditions for an aerodynamic optimization).
Executing the nonlinear solve for this model in parallel offers a large potential speed-up, but when computing total derivatives, achieving that same parallel performance may require the use of
OpenMDAO's parallel coloring algorithm.

.. note::

    Parallel coloring is appropriate when you have some inexpensive serial data path in your model, before the parallel points.
    For more details on when a model calls for parallel coloring see the :ref:`Theory Manual entry on the fan-out model structures<theory_fan_out>`.


Parallel coloring is specified via the :code:`parallel_deriv_color` argument to the :ref:`add_constraint()<feature_add_constraint>` method.
The color specified can be any hashable object (e.g. string, int, tuple).
Two constraints, pointing to variables from different components on different processors, given the same :code:`parallel_deriv_color` argument will be solved for in parallel with each other.
