Driver Debug Printing
*********************

When working with a model, it may sometimes be helpful to print out the design variables, constraints, and
objectives as the :code:`Driver` iterates. OpenMDAO provides options on the :code:`Driver` to let you do that.

Driver Options
-----------------

.. embed-options::
    openmdao.core.driver
    Driver
    options

Usage
-----

This example shows how to use the :code:`Driver` debug printing options. The :code:`debug_print` option is a list of strings.
Valid strings include 'desvars', 'ln_cons', 'nl_cons', and 'objs'. Note that the values for the design variables
printed are unscaled, physical values.


  .. embed-code::
      openmdao.drivers.tests.test_scipy_optimizer.TestScipyOptimizeDriverFeatures.test_debug_print_option
      :layout: interleave

We can also use the debug printing to print some basic information about the derivative calculations so that you can see
which derivative is being solved, how long it takes, and the computed values by including the 'totals' string in the "debug_print" list.

  .. embed-code::
      openmdao.drivers.tests.test_scipy_optimizer.TestScipyOptimizeDriverFeatures.test_debug_print_option_totals
