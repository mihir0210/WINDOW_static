ExecComp
********

`ExecComp` is a component that provides a shortcut for building an ExplicitComponent that
represents a set of simple mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs. The ExecComp
automatically takes care of all of the component API methods, so you just need to instantiate
it with an equation. Derivatives are also automatically determined using the complex step
method.  Because of this, functions available for use in ExecComp are limited to the following
numpy and scipy functions:

For example, here is a simple component that takes the input and adds one to it.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_exec_comp.TestExecComp.test_feature_simple
    :layout: interleave

You can also create an ExecComp with multiple outputs by placing the expressions in a list.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_exec_comp.TestExecComp.test_feature_multi_output
    :layout: interleave

You can also declare an ExecComp with arrays for inputs and outputs, but when you do, you must also
pass in a correctly-sized array as an argument to the ExecComp call. This can be the initial value
in the case of unconnected inputs, or just an empty array with the correct size.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_exec_comp.TestExecComp.test_feature_array
    :layout: interleave

If all of your ExecComp's array inputs and array outputs are the same size and happen to have
diagonal partials, you can create a vectorized ExecComp by specifying a `vectorize=True` arg
to `__init__`.  This will cause the ExecComp to solve for its partials by complex stepping
all entries of an array input at once instead of looping over each entry individually.  Here's
a simple example:


.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_exec_comp.TestExecComp.test_feature_vectorize
    :layout: interleave


Functions from the math library are available for use in the expression strings.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_exec_comp.TestExecComp.test_feature_math
    :layout: interleave


You can also declare options like 'units', 'upper', or 'lower' on the inputs and outputs. Here is an example
where we declare all our inputs to be inches to trigger conversion from a variable expressed in feet in one
connection source.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_exec_comp.TestExecComp.test_feature_metadata
    :layout: interleave
