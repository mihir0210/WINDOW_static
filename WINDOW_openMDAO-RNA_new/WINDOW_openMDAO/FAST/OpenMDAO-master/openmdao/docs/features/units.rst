Units Definitions
-------------------

This is a list of all the units defined by default in the OpenMDAO library.
Any entry in the :code:`[base_units]` or :code:`[units]` sections of the library is a known unit.
Valid prefixes are given in the :code:`[prefixes]` section of the library.

Go :ref:`this document <units>` for details on how to specify units on OpenMDAO variables.
