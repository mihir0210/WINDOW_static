Caching on Travis CI
********************

The concept of build caching on Travis CI is intended to speed up the build, and therefore the entire build/test cycle on Travis CI.
By caching the builds of dependencies/requirements that rarely change, we can get right to our various dependencies to speed up the build
and the docbuild for our everyday testing.

Certain commonly-used things can be easily cached, using code near the top of your .travis.yml file that looks like this:

.. code-block:: none

    cache:
      apt: true
      directories:
        - $HOME/.cache/pip
        - $HOME/pyoptsparse
        - $HOME/miniconda
        - $HOME/miniconda/lib/python$PY/site-packages/pyoptsparse

Later in your .travis.yml file, you need to check for a cached version before you install/don't install an item.
Read the comments for some not-so-intuitive news on what caching does the first time through.

.. code-block:: none

    before_install:

    # Check for existence of files to determine if cache exists
    # If the dir doesn't exist, but is slated to be cached later,
    # Travis unhelpfully creates it, which then causes "dir already exists"
    # errors when you go to actually install the thing, so we must non-intuitively
    # delete the file before re-creating it later.
    - if [ -f $HOME/miniconda/bin/python$PY ]; then
        echo "cached miniconda found -- nothing to do";
      else
        NOT_CACHED_CONDA=1;
        rm -rf $HOME/miniconda;
      fi

Another thing to cache might be something private, like in OpenMDAO's case, the code for SNOPT, to be used inside
our pyoptsparse install. To do this, we need to keep our private code in a private location, then do the following:

    #. Set up passwordless entrance to the secure location with the SNOPT source.
    #. Copy the source into the proper directory on Travis so it can be built and subsequently cached.

In fulfillment of #1, let's get a key decrypted, placed, chmodded, and added for passwordless access to a remote site:
(for full instructions, see :ref:`Advanced Operations, steps 1-3 <advanced_operations_automation>`.)

.. code-block:: none

    - if [ "$MASTER_BUILD" ]; then
        openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_74d70a284b7d_key -iv $encrypted_74d70a284b7d_iv -in travis_deploy_rsa.enc -out /tmp/travis_deploy_rsa -d;
        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)";
        chmod 600 /tmp/travis_deploy_rsa;
        ssh-add /tmp/travis_deploy_rsa;
        echo -e "Host [hostname]\n\tStrictHostKeyChecking no\n" >> ~/.ssh/config;
      fi

In fulfillment of #2, set $SNOPT_LOCATION to be an encrypted variable in your Travis CI settings that contains the
secret location of the private code.
Then we will check, and if the cache doesn't exist, we will copy it in from the secret location, and
then, following a successful build/test, it will get cached.

.. code-block:: none

    - if [ "$NOT_CACHED_PYOPTSPARSE" ]; then
        git clone https://github.com/OpenMDAO/pyoptsparse.git;
        cd pyoptsparse;

        if [ "$MASTER_BUILD" ]; then
          cd pyoptsparse/pySNOPT/source;
          scp -r "$SNOPT_LOCATION" .;
          cd ../../..;
        fi

        python setup.py install;
        cd ..;
      fi

.. note::

    Travis pull requests(PRs) are built as the submitting account. It is a potential vulnerability for someone to be able to submit a PR
    and automatically execute something with the OpenMDAO account keys. Therefore, use of an encrypted variable as described above is not allowed
    by Travis on pull requests. Only after that PR has been merged by a repo owner, during the subsequent master build, the encrypted items will work.
    If that build and test succeeds, only then will encrypted items be cached.  From then onward, subsequent pull-request builds WILL have
    the cached private item in their caches, because the PR builds derive their caches from the master cache.
